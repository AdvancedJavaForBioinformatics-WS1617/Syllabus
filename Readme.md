**Contents**

This course will cover the following topics:

- Java 8
- Version control using GitHub
- Design patterns such as MVC
- Concurrent programming in Java
- GUI design, animation and 3D graphics using JavaFX
- Java web services
- Unit testing

All topics will be taught in the context of bioinformatics applications. 
Note, we will write a lot of code, so a keen interest in programming is essential.

This is **not** an introduction to Java, you must already know Java to participate in this course.

**Assignments and tutorials**

Weekly assignments are handed out in class and are posted on this webpage. We will setup GitHub-classrooms to work with. 

We will discuss how to hand in your first assignment in the lecture on 27.10.

Tutorials will start on October 31st.

**Project**

The second part of the course (after the Christmas break) you will work on a software project in which you will implement an advanced bioinformatics tool. 

**Literature**

The introduction to JavaFX will be based on these books:

    Anton Epple, JavaFX 8, Grundlagen und fortgeschrittene Techniken, dpunkt.verlag 2015
    Herbert Schildt, Introducing JavaFX 8 Programming, Oracle Press, 2015
    Kishori Sharan, Learn JavaFX 8, APress, 2015
    
**How to get credit for this course**

- Always participate in the weekly problem sessions and actively present your results.
- You must received at least 50% of possible points to take the exam. Assignments are set every Thursday and are due on at the beginning of the lecture on the following Thursday.
- Hand in all programming projects
- Pass final exam.

**Final Exam**

The final exam will be a 30 minute oral exam. The first half will cover concepts and constructs presented in the lectures and the second half will cover the structure and implementation of your software project.
